This is my code for how I processed all the PRISM and LOCA data for training and predictions.  

Look at my paths to get an idea of how the data is formatted.

Watersheds.py is currently set up to format the LOCA1 dataset.  
Data_Formatting.py is currently set up to create the LOCA1 daily dataset.  

Model.ipynb is how I trained the model that uses SWE, while Model_Reduced.ipynb is to train the model without SWE.  
Model_predictions.ipynb is obviously to generate predictions for climate scenarios.
